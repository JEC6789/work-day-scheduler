/* 
In my coding bootcamp, the lowest two scores I have are automatically dropped when it ends in August, effectively
allowing me to skip two different assignments for any reason. I think I'm gonna make this one of them.

Moment.js and jQuery are both old technologies that have become obsolete in the modern Internet era.
Polymer or React can be used in place of jQuery, and Moment.js was officially deprecated in 2020.

Additionally, due to circumstances beyond my control, the amount of free time I have this weekend has been
greatly reduced, so I feel like this would be one of the two assignments that's best to skip for me.
Hopefully this is not a decision I will regret.
